* impl
- define db function to schedule a recurring daily job,
  with TZ and hours:mins

* testing road map
- unit tests for all logic
- IT tests that spin up the docker-compose system
  and run tests against it.
- do perf tests with large numbers of re-ocurring tasks.  Is performance OK just iterating the whole list every minute?

* cleanup
- Models being static classes is dumb.
  Instantiate with a ref to the db, and then you don't need it as a parameter.
